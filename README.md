# Epic Trading Terminal

> A personal project to showcase my skills in systems programming, UI design, and real-time data handling — aiming to work at a company like Kraken.

A high-performance trading terminal built in Rust.  
It features a responsive GUI with `iced`, real-time integration with the Binance API, and a focus on clean architecture and speed.
